- [Analyzing Baseball Data & Predict the Winners of 2020 Series](https://github.com/afshin-arab/afshin-arab.github.io/blob/200f6dadaee1a6bf3bc102216b4015858c0ae733/projects/Baseball%20Project/Project.pdf) Baseball has been referred to as America’s national pastime. Since its start in the mid-19th century, the game has grown in popularity across the globe. Many professional leagues have come and gone since the game began, with Major League Baseball (MLB) becoming the premier league. MLB held its first game in 1869 and continues to play games to this day. Financially, the MLB generates a great deal of money, and according to Forbes annual valuation of the MLB, the league generated $10.5 billion in revenue during the 2019 season. However, this year is different. Due to coronavirus, the 2020 season has been vastly changed.The season’s opening day was pushed back by three months and the number of games to be played is now at 60 versus the usual 162 game season. Additionally, fans are not allowed to be in the stadiums when the games are played. Through September 2nd, 41 games have been postponed due to Covid-19 concerns. With all of these changes affecting the game and its players, we want to see if we can accurately predict several data points for the 2020 MLB season.

- [Predict prices of airline tickets](https://github.com/afshin-arab/afshin-arab.github.io/blob/200f6dadaee1a6bf3bc102216b4015858c0ae733/projects/Predict%20prices%20of%20airline%20tickets/Project.ipynb) Here is a small project about predicting the prices of airline tickets based on numerous factors. It does not have a big database but solving/creating this model is a good practice for begginers.
- [Boston Housing Prices](https://github.com/afshin-arab/afshin-arab.github.io/blob/200f6dadaee1a6bf3bc102216b4015858c0ae733/projects/Boston%20Housing%20Prices/Project.ipynb) In this project, we will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a good fit could then be used to make certain predictions about a home's monetary value.

- [Uber Fare Prediction](https://github.com/afshin-arab/afshin-arab.github.io/blob/ac899e3e732ed7e73d2238fa79500fbdeda815ee/projects/Uber%20Fare%20Prediction/Project.ipynb) The main objective of project is to design an algorithm which will tell the fare to be charged for a passenger. Machine learning algorithms are used to develop a regression model.

- [Status of Hotel Bookings](https://github.com/afshin-arab/afshin-arab.github.io/blob/200f6dadaee1a6bf3bc102216b4015858c0ae733/projects/Predict%20status%20of%20Hotel%20Booking/Project.ipynb) A model to predict whether customers cancel their reservations or not?

- [Cross Language Information Retrieval](https://github.com/afshin-arab/afshin-arab.github.io/blob/200f6dadaee1a6bf3bc102216b4015858c0ae733/projects/Cross%20Language%20Information%20Retrieval/Project.ipynb) The aim of this project is to build a cross language information retrieval system (CLIR) which, given a query in German, will be capable of searching text documents written in English and displaying the results in German.

- [Unsupervised Learning - Creating Customer Segments](https://github.com/afshin-arab/afshin-arab.github.io/blob/200f6dadaee1a6bf3bc102216b4015858c0ae733/projects/Customer%20Segments/Porject.ipynb) In this project, we will analyze a dataset containing data on various customers' annual spending amounts (reported in monetary units) of diverse product categories for internal structure. One goal of this project is to best describe the variation in the different types of customers that a wholesale distributor interacts with. Doing so would equip the distributor with insight into how to best structure their delivery service to meet the needs of each customer.

- [Digit Recognition Program](https://github.com/afshin-arab/afshin-arab.github.io/blob/200f6dadaee1a6bf3bc102216b4015858c0ae733/projects/Digit%20Sequence%20Recognition/Project.ipynb) In this project, we will design and implement a deep learning model that learns to recognize sequences of digits. We will train the model using synthetic data generated by concatenating character images from MNIST.
