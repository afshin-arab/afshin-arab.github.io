##Analyzing Baseball Data & Predict the Winners of 2020 Series

####Project Background:
Baseball has been referred to as America’s national pastime. Since its start in the mid-19th century, the game has grown in popularity across the globe. Many professional leagues have come and gone since the game began, with Major League Baseball (MLB) becoming the premier league. MLB held its first game in 1869 and continues to play games to this day. Financially, the MLB generates a great deal of money, and according to Forbes annual valuation of the MLB, the league generated $10.5 billion in revenue during the 2019 season. However, this year is different. Due to coronavirus, the 2020 season has been vastly changed. 
 
The season’s opening day was pushed back by three months and the number of games to be played is now at 60 versus the usual 162 game season. Additionally, fans are not allowed to be in the stadiums when the games are played. Through September 2nd, 41 games have been postponed due to Covid-19 concerns. With all of these changes affecting the game and its players, we want to see if we can accurately predict several data points for the 2020 MLB season.
