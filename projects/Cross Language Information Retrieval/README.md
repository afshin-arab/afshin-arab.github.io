### Cross Language Information Retrieval

The aim of this project is to build a cross language information retrieval system (CLIR) which, given a query in German, will be capable of searching text documents written in English and displaying the results in German.

We're going to use machine translation, information retrieval using a vector space model, and then assess the performance of the system using IR evaluation techniques.

Parts of the project are explained as we progress.
