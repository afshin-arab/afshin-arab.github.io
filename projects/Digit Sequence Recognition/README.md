### Build a Digit Recognition Program
In this project, we will design and implement a deep learning model that learns to recognize sequences of digits. We will train the model using synthetic data generated by concatenating character images from MNIST.

To produce a synthetic sequence of digits for testing, we will limit the to sequences to up to five digits, and use five classifiers on top of your deep network. We will incorporate an additional ‘blank’ character to account for shorter number sequences.

We will use Keras to implement the model. You can read more about Keras at keras.io.
