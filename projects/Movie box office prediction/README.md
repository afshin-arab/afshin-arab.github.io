### Movie Box Office Prediction Using Linear Regression

A very basic project to use linear regression in order to predict the movie box office performance by only using one independent variable, "production budget." The data is obtained from [the-numbers.com](https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets/all/). You can find raw and cleaned data in the project's folder.

**Result**: as expected we reached a R2 score of 0.55 with defines that 55% of variation in the dependent variable (y) is explainable by our independent variable (X).
