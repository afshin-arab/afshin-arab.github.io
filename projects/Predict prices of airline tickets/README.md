Here is a small project about predicting the prices of airline tickets based on numerous factors. It does not have a big database but solving/creating this model is a good practice for begginers. 

On this project I used machine learning automation instead of examining all the models manually. Finally, for cross validation, I chose the random forest algorithm and used Randomized Search CV method.
