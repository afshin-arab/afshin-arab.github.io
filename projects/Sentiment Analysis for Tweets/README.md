In this project, we'll build a 3-way polarity (positive, negative, neutral) classification system for tweets, without using NLTK's in-built sentiment analysis engine.

We'll use a logistic regression classifier, bag-of-words features, and polarity lexicons (both in-built and external). We'll also create our own pre-processing module to handle raw tweets.
